NUPACK INSTRUCTIONS

SETUP
Set up ssh keys between:
	local computer and a host computer,
	host computer and computer computers.
Set the env variable MASTER=<user>@<ip>

Copy the main viral-db folder to a separate computer 
	(Assuming you don't want to keep your local computer running for days!)

Make the file IP_list.txt in the params folder on MASTER. (Create the folder and file if not there.)
	Each line should be a single entry for a given compute node, with the following format:
	<# cores>/<user>@<ip>
	Example:
	8/administrator@1.1.1.1
	16/administrator@1.2.1.1

run setup-nupack-slave.sh. It takes a list of compute nodes, input with the form <user>@<ip>

EXECUTION:
on the local computer (The one with the database), run generate_nupack_files.py.
On the master node, run run_nupack.py.
	Recommended you do this with the screen command.

When that finishes, run parse-nupack-res.py on the local computer.

That should leave a new collection in the database, called nupack. Will be joined into the main dataset later.

USING SCREEN:
Screen is a command line tool to have virtual terminal sessions, so you can close it and resume it later.
How to use:
$ screen
> This opens an interface equivalent to the regular terminal. Run the commands here, like run_nupack.py
> To 'detach' from the screen and return to the regular terminal, press ctrl+a , then d.

$ screen -r
> This reattaches to the screen that has been detached, resuming the session and viewing the previous output.
