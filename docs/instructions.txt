This is a clean, searchable, viral database based off of MongoDB.
Currently only unix-based OSes are supported. (Linux, OSX)

To create a database, the standard procedure would be:

1) Install MongoDB.
2) Start the Mongo server. (Run mongod in a separate terminal or in the background)
3) Add data in to the database, by running these scripts:
	python fetch_genbanks.py
	python create-viraldb.py
	python generate-indexes.py all clean short_clean
	python vis.py
	OR
	run the script create.sh.

INSTALLING MONGODB:
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
TLS/SSL support is not nessasary.

A tutorial on mongodb, in the case you want to directly query the database:
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/introduction/

To view data shape, go into the mongo shell (by running the command monogo) and run the commands:
use viraldb
db.all_data.findOne()
db.all_indexes.findOne()

Useful mongo shell commands:

show dbs
Shows the databases.

use <db>
Sets <db> as the active database.

show collections
Shows the collections in the active database.
